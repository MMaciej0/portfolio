            I&apos;m Maciej MÄ…dry, a self-taught frontend developer from Poland.
            My journey into programming began at the start of the Covid19
            pandemic. Initially, I explored Python tutorials, but found them
            somewhat dull. Then, by chance, I discovered HTML and CSS, and
            something clicked. Suddenly, the results of my code weren&apos;t
            just console prompts, and that attracted me to dig deeper. Fast
            forward to 2024, and I&apos;m still immersed in learning frontend
            technologies, feeling like i&apos;ll never lose enthusiasm.
            <p className="py-2">
              When brainstorming new projects, I prioritize exploring
              programming topics I want to delve into, while also considering
              real-world use cases. Looking ahead i want to master frontend
              part, then i&apos;ll aim backend development to become a
              well-rounded programmer.

            Besides programming, I love doing sports, expecially cycling.
            Occasionally, I also engage in weightlifting and running. I believe
            that having hobbies outside of coding and work is essential for
            maintaining good mental health.
