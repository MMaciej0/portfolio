            I&apos;m Maciej MÄ…dry, a self-taught frontend developer from Poland.
            My journey into programming began at the start of the Covid19
            pandemic. Initially, I explored Python tutorials, but found them
            somewhat dull. Then, by chance, I discovered HTML and CSS, and
            something clicked. Suddenly, the results of my code weren&apos;t
            just console prompts, and that attracted me to dig deeper. Fast
            forward to 2024, and I&apos;m still immersed in learning frontend
            technologies, feeling like i&apos;ll never lose enthusiasm.
            <p className="py-2">
              When brainstorming new projects, I prioritize exploring
              programming topics I want to delve into, while also considering
              real-world use cases. Looking ahead i want to master frontend
              part, then i&apos;ll aim backend development to become a
              well-rounded programmer.

            <p>
              I specialize in frontend development, with a focus on{" "}
              <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, all of my applications are written using{" "}
              <strong>Typescript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwindcss</strong> for
              styling and responsiveness. In my projects, you will also find{" "}
              <strong>Zod</strong> and <strong>React Hook Form</strong> for
              validation and form submission. Since user registration and
              authentication are essential for most websites, I utilize{" "}
              <strong>Auth.js</strong> and <strong>Clerk</strong>. Currently, I
              store web data using <strong>MongoDB</strong> in conjunction with{" "}
              <strong>Prisma</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I try to stay up to date with newly created libraries and
              incorporate them into my projects as much as I can, which is why
              the above-mentioned technologies are just an example of the most
              frequently used ones.

            Besides programming, I love doing sports, expecially cycling.
            Occasionally, I also engage in weightlifting and running. I believe
            that having hobbies outside of coding and work is essential for
            maintaining good mental health.
